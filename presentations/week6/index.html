          <p> This wireframe fixes the problem as all the main content is big and can be clearly be seen by the user. I also have placed everything in the center where the layout wont appear to be random or uneven or seem to be out of place in any way. I always find that when content is lined up and in the center, it gives a more clean layout rather than having content all over the webpage or all squished into one area.</p><p> On the outside, we’ll gently wash away the salty grime that has been building up, with a full range of auto detailing services.
